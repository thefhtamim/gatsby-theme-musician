**Hello there! You are looking at the placeholder content of [gatsby-theme-musician](https://github.com/ekafyi/gatsby-theme-musician) 🎸.** It is a [Gatsby theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/what-are-gatsby-themes/) for bands and solo artists to create a landing page—that is also versatile enough to be extended into a full website and combined with other themes to add other functionalities, if you want to.

This theme comes with several components out of the box, such as the _“Releases”_ and _“Shows”_ sections below. You can see the complete list on the [Sample Page](/sample-page). To learn about how to use this theme and add your content, check out the [Theme Documentation](https://github.com/ekafyi/gatsby-theme-musician/tree/master/docs). Or read the [introductory post and walkthrough](https://dev.to/ekafyi/make-a-landing-page-for-your-band-in-30-minutes-with-gatsby-theme-musician-2227).

Have fun and rock on!
